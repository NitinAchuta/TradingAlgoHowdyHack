#When inputting the stock please only input the Ticker.

#The ticker can be found by googling the name of the stock and putting ticker at the end.

#Example: To find the ticker of Apple, google 'Apple ticker'
The first part labeled 'NASDAQ: ' is simply the index it is in. Please ignore this part and put just the ticker. For Apple, the ticker value is "AAPL".
Then, input your ticker ('AAPL' in our test case) into the terminal and you will get the information you need to decide if you should buy this stock.
