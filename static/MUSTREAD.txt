When inputting the stock please only input the Ticker.

The ticker can be found by googling the name of the stock and putting ticker at the end.

Example: To find the ticker of Apple, google 'Apple ticker'
    You should get a page from google of the basic financials and under the name and logo you should see 'APPL'.
    The first part labeled 'NASDAQ: ' is simply the index it is in. Please ignore this part and put just the ticker.
    So to find the current rating of Apple, input 'AAPL' into the terminal and you should get all the information you need to decide if you want to buy this stock.
